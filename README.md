# Salesforce Related Python Scripts
Set of quick and dirty python scripts I wrote to automate certain repetitive  things I had to do in salesforce.

Very often I was required to fetch stuff like list of all required fields on a layout, list of validation rules that were were based on a certain validation rule, find mapped names in a report type. 
Most of these tasks can be done quickly by taking a "retrieve" of the objects, report types etc  and parse the retrieved metadata. 

This repo contains some of those scripts I wrote. These aren't the neatest and most efficient codes but they got the job done for me. Will try and improve them over time.
